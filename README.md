# Analyzing the effect of Covid-19 lockdown on **New York Taxi Market**

- As a data analyst working for ‘Fast Cars’, a company planning to enter the New York taxi market in competition with Uber and Ola , I analyzed the situation  prevailing in the market  with respect to February 2020 dataset i.e. before lockdown and July 2020 dataset for after lockdown situations.
- Initially dataset had 21 columns out which 3 not useful columns were removed;
  ’payment_type’ column was converted as names of payment types instead of integer values ;
For the month of July , ‘passenger_count’ and ‘payment_type’ column had around 8% of values missing which was replaced with ‘not_available’ .
- Univariate analysis and then Bivariate analysis was done after identifying  continuous and discrete  columns  separately.
- Key Insights -Number of Taxi users after lockdown decreased to 10% of total taxi users before lockdown Credit cards are the most preferred payment type used by customers; peak   hours changed after lockdown because most of the people were still working from home
- Key skills used - EDA in python ,Pandas , Statistics, datetime library
